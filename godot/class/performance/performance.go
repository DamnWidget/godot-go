   This class provides access to a number of different monitors related to performance, such as memory usage, draw calls, and FPS. These are the same as the values displayed in the [i]Monitor[/i] tab in the editor's [i]Debugger[/i] panel. By using the [method get_monitor] method of this class, you can access this data from your code. Note that a few of these monitors are only available in debug mode and will always return 0 when used in a release build. Many of these monitors are not updated in real-time, so there may be a short delay between changes.
